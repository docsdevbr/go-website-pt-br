We're excited to announce that the biannual Go Developer Survey is now open! From today, **September 9th**, until **September 23rd**, we invite you to share your experiences, opinions, and insights about the Go programming language and its ecosystem.

Your responses help us understand:

* The challenges you face as a Go developer
* The features and improvements you'd like to see in future releases
* How we can better support the thriving Go community

Your participation directly influences the future of Go and ensures that the language evolves to meet the needs of developers worldwide. Please take 10-15 minutes to [take the survey now!](https://google.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_ei0CDV2K9qQIsp8?s=b)

**Spread the Word!**

Help us reach as many Go developers as possible! Share the survey with your colleagues, friends, and online communities. The more voices we hear, the better we can understand the diverse needs of the Go community.
