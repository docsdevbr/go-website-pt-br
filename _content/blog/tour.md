We are excited to announce [A Tour of Go](/tour/),
a guided tour of the Go programming language you can run from your browser.

The tour is hands-on, demonstrating the language through code samples that you can modify,
compile, and run from the tour itself.
(The technology behind the [Go Playground](/doc/play/) does the work.)

The tour has four sections. The first section covers basic syntax and data structures;
the second discusses methods and interfaces;
the third is about Generics;
and the fourth introduces Go's concurrency primitives.
Each section concludes with a few exercises so you can practice what you've learned.

So, what are you waiting for? [Get started now!](/tour/)
