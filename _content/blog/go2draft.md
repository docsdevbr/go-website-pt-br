Yesterday, at our annual Go contributor summit,
attendees got a sneak peek at preliminary _drafts_ of
possible designs for changes to error handling and generics.
[The development of Go 2](/blog/toward-go2) was announced last year and we are excited to share updates with you today.

For a quick overview, watch this short message we just played at Gophercon 2018:

and help us improve them.
