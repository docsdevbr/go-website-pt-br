Today the Go team is excited to release Go 1.24,
which you can get by visiting the [download page](/dl/).

Go 1.24 comes with many improvements over Go 1.23. Here are some of the notable
changes; for the full list, refer to the [release notes](/doc/go1.24).

## Language changes

<!-- go.dev/issue/46477 -->
Go 1.24 now fully supports [generic type aliases](/issue/46477): a type alias
may be parameterized like a defined type.
See the [language spec](/ref/spec#Alias_declarations) for details.

## Performance improvements

<!-- go.dev/issue/54766, go.dev/cl/614795, go.dev/issue/68578 -->
Several performance improvements in the runtime have decreased CPU overhead
by 2â€“3% on average across a suite of representative benchmarks. These
improvements include a new builtin `map` implementation based on
[Swiss Tables](https://abseil.io/about/design/swisstables), more efficient
memory allocation of small objects, and a new runtime-internal mutex
implementation.

## Tool improvements

- <!-- go.dev/issue/48429 -->
  The `go` command now provides a mechanism for tracking tool dependencies for a
  module. Use `go get -tool` to add a `tool` directive to the current module. Use
  `go tool [tool name]` to run the tools declared with the `tool` directive.
  Read more on the [go command](/doc/go1.24#go-command) in the release notes.
- <!-- go.dev/issue/44251 -->
  The new `test` analyzer in `go vet` subcommand reports common mistakes in
  declarations of tests, fuzzers, benchmarks, and examples in test packages.
  Read more on [vet](/doc/go1.24#vet) in the release notes.

## Standard library additions

- The standard library now includes [a new set of mechanisms to facilitate
  FIPS 140-3 compliance](/doc/security/fips140). Applications require no source code
  changes to use the new mechanisms for approved algorithms. Read more
  on [FIPS 140-3 compliance](/doc/go1.24#fips140) in the release notes.
  Apart from FIPS 140, several packages that were previously in the
  [x/crypto](/pkg/golang.org/x/crypto) module are now available in the
  [standard library](/doc/go1.24#crypto-mlkem).

- Benchmarks may now use the faster and less error-prone
  [`testing.B.Loop`](/pkg/testing#B.Loop) method to perform benchmark iterations
  like `for b.Loop() { ... }` in place of the typical loop structures involving
  `b.N` like `for range b.N`. Read more on
  [the new benchmark function](/doc/go1.24#new-benchmark-function) in the
  release notes.

- The new [`os.Root`](/pkg/os#Root) type provides the ability to perform
  filesystem operations isolated under a specific directory. Read more on
  [filesystem access](/doc/go1.24#directory-limited-filesystem-access) in the
  release notes.

- The runtime provides a new finalization mechanism,
  [`runtime.AddCleanup`](/pkg/runtime#AddCleanup), that is more flexible,
  more efficient, and less error-prone than
  [`runtime.SetFinalizer`](/pkg/runtime#SetFinalizer). Read more on
  [cleanups](/doc/go1.24#improved-finalizers) in the release notes.

## Improved WebAssembly support

<!-- go.dev/issue/65199, CL 603055 -->
Go 1.24 adds a new `go:wasmexport` directive for Go programs to export
functions to the WebAssembly host, and supports building a Go program as a WASI
[reactor/library](https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/blob/63a46f61052a21bfab75a76558485cf097c0dbba/legacy/application-abi.md#current-unstable-abi).
Read more on [WebAssembly](/doc/go1.24#wasm) in the release notes.
